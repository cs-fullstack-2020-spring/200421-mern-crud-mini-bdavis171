# 20-04-21 MERN CRUD Mini Project
## Library Card Records

### All requirements met! Would have liked to se more detail on your wire frame. Nice touch with the personal styling and more comments in your client.
### Score : 5/5 

### Workflow
- Draw a wire frame illustrating all pages and how you can navigate from one page to the next
- Include the wire frame in your repo
- We will have stand ups at 10:30am, 1:00pm, and 2:30pm. Push within ten minutes of each stand up (at minimum)
### Purpose
Create a fullstack MERN application utilizing CRUD + 1 that allows librarians to access and manipulate library card records
### Model
- Library Card Holder's Name
- Library Card Number (unique)
- Library Card Holder's Phone Number
- Library Card Holder's Zip Code
### Pages
- Display all library card holders names and card numbers
- Create a new library card holder
- Detail page with all holder information 
    - navigate to this page by clicking on a library card holders name
    - include a button to delete a library card holder
- Edit a library card holder's information
     - navigate to this page from a library card holder's detail page via a button or link
### Bonus
If you finish before the assignment is due
- Add styling to all pages
- Confirm that the user wants to delete a library card holder before deleting the document
- Redirect automatically back to the display all page when the delete or update form is submitted
